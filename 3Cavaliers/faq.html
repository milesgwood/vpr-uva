				<h2 class="vpr-page-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<p>Here are some common questions, if you do not find what you are looking for please contact us!</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">What is 3 Cavaliers?</h3>
				<p>3 Cavaliers is a seed funding program developed to stimulate and support innovative research. Seed Funding for $60K and $15K projects. The faculty members can choose which level of funding they would like to receive. 3 Cavaliers is three faculty members collaborating on a new idea that might not be ready for other types of funding.</p>					
				<h3 class="section-heading">When will this be available</h3>
				<p>We are currently working on building the website, we anticipate July 2018 as a go live date for the program, with a submisson deadline of early September 2018.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">What is a token?</h3>
				<p>A token is a voucher that can be exchanged for the matching funds for a project.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">How do I get a token?</h3>
				<p>Schools/units determine how many tokens they wish to invest in, which of their faculty will receive a token, and the level of faculty contribution.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">How do I use a token?</h3>
				<p>Faculty members create a new project and find two partners (at least one of which must be from a different unit a total of 3 faculty) to work together on a new project that have a token available. This is called a "trio". Then through the 3C website, submit the project description before the deadline.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">What is a trio?</h3>
				<p>A trio (also called a Cavalier Trio) is a funded project with three faculty members.  Faculty members create projects and invite collaborators to join them.  A project that has three tokens associated with it is ready to become a trio.  The owner can then decide to create the trio on the website to formally submit the project.  Once a trio is formed, the faculty members cannot be changed.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">What can I do on the 3 Cavaliers website?</h3>
				<p>Faculty members can create project descriptions, search for collaborators and projects, and obtain research funding for their trio.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">How do I find partners</h3>
				<p>The 3C website has a UVA faculty database. You can search to easily find possible collaborators.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">If I have previously published papers with two other faculty members, and want to now form a trio, is that allowed?</h3>
				<p>As long as the project is new, innovative research, and you have not worked on the same external grant, that is fine.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">I have a grant with one faculty member and a different grant with a second faculty member.  I want to form a trio with these two people on a totally new research project.  Can I do that?</h3>
				<p>Yes.  The restriction is that the three faculty members cannot be working on a project together that already has external funding.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">How many projects can I create?</h3>
				<p>Faculty members can create as many projects as they want.  However, each faculty member can only participate in one trio.<br>
				<h3 class="section-heading">Can I put my token on a project that I didn’t create?</h3>
				<p>To join a project that you didn’t create, you must be invited to place your token on that project.<br>
				<h3 class="section-heading">Will my project need to be scientifically reviewed before it will be funded?</h3>
				<p>No, this is one of the unique aspects of the program.  Essentially, by the three faculty members reviewing the project and agreeing to use their one token on the project, they have performed the peer review through their actions.  There will be administrative checks to make sure that the requirements of the program are being met, but there will not be a review of the projects themselves prior to funding.<br>	
				<h3 class="section-heading">When do I get the money?</h3>
				<p>All qualified trios received by the deadline will be randomized and funded based only on if they meet the administrative requirements of the program. There is no review process beyond mutual agreement of your peers on the project.<br>
				<h3 class="section-heading">How does the selection process work?</h3>
				<p>The goal of this process is to ensure that all participating units (schools, colleges, etc.) in 3C have representation in the trios before shifting to a completely random lottery system.  (Note:  This goal can only be achieved when faculty from all participating units in 3C invest their tokens in projects that request a trio, and when those units have sufficient numbers of tokens that can be funded.)  In accordance with the “no traditional peer review” principle of 3C, the selection process algorithm does not evaluate the quality of projects in any way.
				<br>
				<li>Step 1. At the close of the trio requested period, the list of submitted projects is sorted into a random list. </li>
				<li>Step 2. The first project on the list is made into a trio. </li>
				<li>Step 3. If the next project (a) contains faculty from a unit that is not represented in the trio projects thus far and (b) the units          of all the faculty in the trio still have tokens remaining, the project is made into a trio; otherwise, the project is skipped.</li>
				<li>Step 4. Subtract one token from the units of each faculty member in the trio.</li>
				<li>Step 5. Repeat step 3-4 until all the submissions have been examined.</li>
				<li>Step 6. Start at the top of the list again and trio the projects in order if (a) the project has not already been made into a trio and (b) the             units of all the faculty members in the trio still have tokens remaining.</li>
				<li>Step 7. Subtract one token from the units of each faculty member in the trio.</li>
				<li>Step 8. Continue down the list, making the projects into trios until the either all projects are funded or all funds have been committed.</li>
				<h3 class="section-heading">How long do I have to spend the money?</h3>
				<p>Projects will be notified they have been awarded and funds set up for immediate use. Projects are for one year, with up to six months extension.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">Can I spend the money any way I want?</h3>
				<p>Each project MUST use at least 50% of the funding to support a UVA undergraduate student, graduate student or postdoctoral student. The remaining 50% of the funds can be used for equipment, supplies, lab fees, subject incentives, staff support, travel and other non salary items. Faculty salaries are not allowable expenses.</p>
				<h3 class="section-heading">What are the reporting requirements?</h3>
				<p>You will need to submit a brief final report and participate in a symposium.</p>
