<h2>Biography</h2>
<h5>Jeffrey Plank</h5><p align="left"><img src="../images/Plank.jpg" alt="Jeffrey Plank" width="92" height="125" align="left" hspace="5" />Jeffrey  Plank is Associate Vice President for Research.   He coordinates the identification, conceptualization, and implementation  of large-scale institution-wide research initiatives, most recently the  pan-University sustainability institute.   As leader of the UVA Bay Game project, Plank pioneered development of an  innovative participatory simulation that now serves as a proof-of-concept for  demonstrating the potential of digital and social media to motivate personal  and collective behavior change for environmental conservation.  The defining features of the UVA Bay Game—its  collaborative, high-impact, and &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; conversion of problems into  opportunities—will distinguish the University&rsquo;s sustainability institute.  <center>
<p align="left">In  2009  Plank completed a three-part book series on architectural photography,  building restoration, and architectural history, using the American modern  architect Louis Sullivan and long neglected photograph archives of his work as  his case study.  A major 2008 exhibit in  Chicago on this project was hailed by the Chicago Tribune as one of the 10 best  of the year.  </p>
  <p align="left">Prior  to joining the University in 1993,  Plank held academic and administrative  positions at the University of Southern California, Georgia Tech, and the  University of Chicago.  He also has  provided strategic planning, management, and fundraising counsel to the  National Geographic Society, the American Research Center in Egypt, and the  Leakey Foundation and has managed USAID projects in South Africa and Botswana.</p>
