<h2>Biography</h2>
<h5>Alan &quot;Rick&quot; Horwitz</h5>
<p><img src="../images/Horwitz.jpg" alt="Rick Horwitz" width="92" height="125" align="left" hspace="5" />Alan &ldquo;Rick&rdquo; Horwitz is the Harrison Distinguished Professor of Cell Biology  and renowned worldwide for his pioneering research and leadership in the fields  of cell adhesion and migration. This research impacts many biological  processes, diseases, and therapeutic strategies, including  cancer, neurogenesis, inflammation, and tissue regeneration and repair.  Rick    earned  his  BA with honors in the Honors Program  at the University  of Wisconsin, where he majored in Chemistry with additional concentrations in  math and physics. He received his Ph.D. in Biophysics at Stanford and did  post-doctoral research in the Laboratory for Chemical Biodynamics at UC  Berkeley. Over the past 10 years, in addition to his research and  teaching activities, he  was the  Director of the Cell  Migration Consortium, an ~$80M  international,  interdisciplinary collaboration, comprised of  35 PIs from 20  institutions, focused on developing a spectrum of novel approaches and methods,  from genomic to biophysical and mathematical, for studying cell migration in  its many biological contexts. The Consortium now serves as a model for how to  organize and manage collaborative, interdisciplinary science on a large scale.  Rick  continues  his research on adhesion, migration, and synapse formation in learning and  memory. In 2010, Rick was a  recipient of the University of Virginia's Distinguished Scientist Award. He has  mentored over 50 students and postdocs, many of  whom hold positions in  top academic institutions  and companies. <br />
  <br />
  Rick&rsquo;  s  experience in  administration and program development began  at  the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, where he  chaired the undergraduate Biophysics Program and served as the Associate  Director of the Medical Scientist Training Program.&nbsp; At  the University of Illinois, he served as the Head of a new cell  and developmental biology department in the College of Arts and Sciences and  quickly built a top rated department, while developing successful undergraduate  and graduate curricula and majors, rebuilding a Cell and Molecular Biology  Training Program, and co-authoring a Markey Center for Neuroscience. He also  catalyzed and steered the reorganization of the life sciences and chaired the  campus Research Policy Committee in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for  Research.  Rick has  been active in grant and program review through service on study sections and  on institutional, NIH, and agency strategic planning and  advisory committees both here and in Europe, and has served as a Councilor of  the American Society for Cell Biology. He has organized many international  meetings and delivered keynote lectures and symposium presentations at  major bioscience societies in the Americas, Europe, and Asia,  and has served in editorial capacities for the major journals in his field.<br />
  <br />
  As Associate Vice  President for Research and Bioscience Programs, he coordinates bioscience  research across grounds, develops interdisciplinary and cross-grounds  collaborations, and integrates university leadership and faculty for  research-related activities in bioscience. &nbsp;Rick&rsquo;s responsibilities  include designing, leading, and implementing new pan-university programs,  raising the level of bioscience overall, designing and implementing new collaborative  initiatives, and evaluating startup, retention, and bridge funding requests. He recently catalyzed and led a  University-wide &quot;Big Data&quot; initiative that led to the formation of  the new &quot;Data Science Institute&quot;&nbsp; that conjoins data-related  teaching, research and services in the sciences, engineering, math and  statistics, biomedical research, the humanities, commerce and business and the  social sciences.</p>
