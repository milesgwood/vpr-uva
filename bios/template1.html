<h2>Biography</h2>
<h5>First Last</h5>
Dr. Allen has written over one hundred (100) publications  on lunar and meteoritic analysis, application of nuclear analytical techniques  to archaeology, trace elements in cancer, radiation effects, analytical  chemistry, forensic science and the impact of pollution on the  environment.  Awarded fellowships for  research in Norway by Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial  Research (1977) and Norwegian Marshall Fund (1983).  Awarded Erikson Award by Federal Bureau of  Investigation for service to the forensic science community.  Dr. Allen has also served on the faculty for  Facilities Institute of the Association of Physical Plant Administrators since  1984, and been a tour speaker for the American Chemical Society since  1984.  He has served as a consultant for  the International Atomic Energy Agency on radioactive waste disposal methods.<br />
  <br />
While the complete publication list indicates the  diversity of research interests, it does not reflect the broad range of  experience in teaching and service.  In  addition to teaching advanced courses in instrumental analytical techniques and  in nuclear chemistry, Dr. Allen has introduced innovative teaching methods to  courses that address the impact of pollution on human health and the  environment.  By bringing the staff of  experts from the Office of Environmental Health and Safety into the Environment  Health course that he teaches,  the  students have practical real world applications and problems to study.  Cooperative learning, case studies and  assessment methods are used to give students an active learning and team  building experience.  In addition to  academic courses for University of Virginia students, the responsibilities as  Director of Environmental Health and Safety have kept Dr. Allen active in the  development and delivery of short training programs for all levels of staff,  faculty, and students at the University.   This has included programs meeting OSHA (Right to Know, Chemical  Hygiene, emergency planning) and USNRC requirements.  Each year, several thousand University  personnel must be trained through these programs.<br />
<br />
Training to comply with regulations is only one aspect of  the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Environmental Health and Safety Program.  The guiding principals are for the staff to  learn about pending regulatory programs and then find how and where they impact  on the University.  With a good  understanding of the institutional needs (in research, teaching and health  care) the office attempts to define and implement responses that support rather  than deter the institution&rsquo;s programs while providing regulatory  compliance.  Any number of cost effective  and efficient programs have been implemented that provide greater awareness and  positive support from the faculty and staff.  <br />
<br />
The practical experience gained in developing and managing  the innovative health and safety programs for the University have been shared  with other institutions.  Through the  Association of Physical Plant Administrators (APPA), Dr. Allen has combined his  experience as a teacher and manager of health and safety programs with the  insight that has come from a close interaction with the University of Virginia  Facilities Management organization.     The courses Dr. Allen has taught for APPA&rsquo;s Facilities Management  Institute help provide insight and practical solutions to problems faced by all  institutions of higher education.  Dr.  Allen, as an invited lecturer, has also presented this same type of positive  assistance at APPA meetings as well as those presented by the American Chemical  Society, National Association of Educational Buyers, and other national  organizations.  As a tour speaker for the  American Chemical Society (ACS), Dr. Allen has not only presented seminars on  his research but has been an advocate for the chemist&rsquo;s responsibility to address  issues of hazardous materials and to protect the environment.  As the faculty liaison with the FBI&rsquo;s  Laboratory Division, Dr. Allen has not only taken an active role in helping law  enforcement agencies develop programs for the safety of their laboratory  personnel, but has been an active participant in numerous research projects as  well.<br />
While Dr. Allen&rsquo;s scientific expertise helps him better  understand large and small scale environmental processes, his interest has been  to find practical measures that can be used to find ways to conduct business  while protecting human health and the environment.<br />
