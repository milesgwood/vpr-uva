<h2>Phil Trella</h2>
<p><img src="../images/Trella.jpg" alt="Phil Trella" width="92" height="125" align="left" hspace="5"/>Phil Trella is Assistant Vice President for Graduate  Studies. His work focuses on enhancing graduate student and postdoctoral  recruitment and retention, and upon coordinating university-wide efforts in  graduate studies and postdoctoral affairs.   To this end, one of Phil&rsquo;s primary concerns is the promotion of more  integrated cultures among both graduate students and postdoctoral researchers  at UVa.  To meet these goals he is  working to increase fellowship opportunities that stimulate innovative and  multidisciplinary research, to enhance diversity within the ranks of graduate  students and postdocs, and to broaden and strengthen the university&rsquo;s efforts  in career development and placement.  <br />
  <br />
  Phil earned his Ph.D. in anthropology in 2010 from the  University of Virginia.  His research  interests include ancient food production systems, the disintegration of  complex societies, and long-term environmental change. He has conducted  anthropological and archaeological research in the North America, Europe, and  the Middle East.  As an undergraduate he  studied abroad and participated in research in northern Finland where he  developed an ongoing interest in the lives of pastoral peoples.  More recent archaeological research concerns  the &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; of some of the world&rsquo;s first cities across northern Iraq,  northern Syria, and southeastern Turkey at the close of the third millennium  B.C. <br />
  <br>
  Before joining the staff at VPR Phil held a postdoc position  with the Sciences Humanities and Arts Network for Technological Initiatives (SHANTI)  where he worked to advance digital scholarship among faculty and graduate  students at UVA.<!-- end Page Content -->
