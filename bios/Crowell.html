<h2>Biography</h2>
<h5>Mark Crowell</h5>
<p><img src="../images/Crowell2.jpg" alt="Mark Crowell" width="92" height="125" align="left" hspace=5 />W. Mark Crowell is executive director of <a href="http://innovation.virginia.edu/">U.Va. Innovation</a> and associate vice   president for research at the University of Virginia. Crowell's 25-year career   in university innovation includes extensive experience in technology licensing,   start-up company formation, seed capital development, innovation-based economic   development initiatives and planning, and research campus planning.</p>
<p>Crowell joined U.Va. in 2010 after serving as vice president for business   development at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and Jupiter,   Fla., where his responsibilities included innovation management and   commercialization, new business development, bio-pharmaceutical industry   partnerships and venture capital relations. Prior to joining Scripps in early   2009, Crowell spent 8.5 years as associate vice chancellor for economic   development and technology transfer at the University of North Carolina at   Chapel Hill, after holding similar positions at North Carolina State University   (1992–2000) and Duke University (1987–1992). The technology transfer programs he   has directed — those at UNC, NC State and Duke — have helped to launch more than   135 start-up companies as well as numerous products and services. In North   Carolina, Crowell served on the boards of key economic development and   entrepreneurial support agencies, including the North Carolina Biotechnology   Center, the Council for Entrepreneurial Development, the Research Triangle   Regional Partnership and the Orange County Economic Development Commission.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Crowell has led many public–private collaborations,   including co-founding a $10 million seed fund at NC State in partnership with   the NC Technology Development Authority. Crowell also had extensive involvement   in planning and managing the widely acclaimed Centennial Campus, a more than   1,200-acre research campus at NC State.</p>
<p>Crowell served as president of the Association of University Technology   Managers (AUTM) in 2005 and is the founding president of the AUTM Foundation. He   currently serves as co-chair of BIO&rsquo;s Technology Transfer Committee and as a   member of the board of directors of Southeast BIO. He has extensive national and   international speaking, consulting and management experience related to   technology transfer and innovation-based economic development and has been   instrumental in forging international research and innovation transfer   partnerships. His consulting and advisory activities have included a number of   U.S. and international academic and policy groups and associations, including   the National Science Foundation, the American Association for Advancement of   Science (AAAS), the National Academies of Sciences, the World Intellectual   Property Organization, the Los Alamos National Laboratory and many others.   Crowell also served on the inaugural board of the University–Industry   Demonstration Partnership, an initiative coordinated through the National   Academies of Sciences designed to expand collaborations between universities and   industry.</p>
